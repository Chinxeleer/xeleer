                        "I'm a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics student at the University of the Witwatersrand,
                        with a strong foundation in both programming and mathematics. My work focuses on leveraging these 
                        skills to build robust and innovative projects.
                        I’m particularly drawn to Rust 🦀 and web development,
                        and I aim to build as much as possible in Rust — including this very website."
